# 📁 **Directory-Based Data Loading System - Complete Implementation**

## 🎯 **System Overview**

The Routing AI Agent has been completely updated to use **directory-based data loading** instead of file uploads. The system now automatically reads Excel files from a specified directory location.

---

## 🔧 **What Changed**

### **❌ BEFORE (Upload-Based):**
- Users had to manually upload Excel files through web interface
- Files were processed in memory only
- No persistent data storage
- Manual file management required

### **✅ AFTER (Directory-Based):**
- Excel files are automatically loaded from a specified directory
- System monitors directory for new/updated files
- Persistent data caching
- Automatic file discovery and loading

---

## 📂 **Directory Configuration**

### **Default Data Directory:**
```
/Users/rajvi/patient_data
```

### **Supported File Formats:**
- `.xlsx` (Excel 2007+)
- `.xls` (Excel 97-2003)

### **Auto-Loading Behavior:**
- System automatically loads the **most recent** Excel file on startup
- Files are sorted by modification time (newest first)
- Data is cached in memory for fast access

---

## 🛠️ **New API Endpoints**

### **Data Management:**
```
GET  /data-status           - Get current data loading status
GET  /available-files       - List available Excel files
POST /load-file/{filename}  - Load specific file
POST /refresh-data          - Reload most recent file
POST /set-data-directory    - Change data directory path
```

### **Patient Data:**
```
GET  /patients              - Get all loaded patients
GET  /sample-data           - Get expected Excel format info
```
