## üåê API Usage Examples

### Direct API Calls

```python
import requests

# Route a patient case
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/route-patient", json={
    "patient_data": {
        "patient_id": "P001",
        "name": "John Smith",
        "age": 72,
        "gender": "Male",
        "diagnosis": "Diabetes Type 2, Hypertension",
        "medications": ["Metformin 500mg", "Lisinopril 10mg"],
        "current_symptoms": ["Fatigue", "Dizziness"],
        "mobility_status": "Ambulatory with walker"

## üéØ Expected AI Responses

### With Google AI Studio

**Routing Decision Example:**
```json
{
  "patient_id": "P003",
  "recommended_agents": ["nursing", "pharmacy"],
  "reasoning": "Patient presents with post-surgical complications including wound drainage and fever, indicating potential infection. Immediate nursing assessment is critical for wound evaluation and vital signs monitoring. Pharmacy consultation needed to review antibiotic therapy and pain management protocols.",
  "priority_score": 9,
  "estimated_timeline": "Within 2 hours"
}
```

**Nursing Agent Response:**
```json
{
  "agent_type": "nursing",
  "recommendations": [
    "Immediate comprehensive wound assessment",
    "Vital signs monitoring every 4 hours",
    "Wound culture if drainage appears infected",
    "Pain assessment using standardized scale"
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "Schedule urgent home visit within 2 hours",
    "Coordinate with physician for potential antibiotic adjustment",
    "Provide family education on infection signs"
  ],
  "form_data": {
    "title": "Nursing Care Coordination Form",
    "recipient": "Home Health Agency",
