# Routing AI Agent Healthcare MVP - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Routing AI Agent is a complete healthcare application MVP that uses AI to intelligently route patient cases to appropriate downstream agents (Nursing, DME, or Pharmacy). The system processes synthetic patient data from Excel files and caregiver input through a web dashboard to make routing decisions and generate structured responses with editable forms.

- **Error handling and logging** throughout the application

### 2. Routing Agent ✅
- **Intelligent routing algorithm** that analyzes patient data and caregiver input
- **Priority scoring system** (1-10 scale) based on urgency and complexity
- **Multi-agent recommendations** when cases require multiple specialties
- **Fallback logic** for when AI services are unavailable

### 3. Downstream Agents ✅
- **Nursing Agent**: Handles care assessments, vital signs monitoring, wound care
- **DME Agent**: Manages durable medical equipment needs, insurance authorizations
- **Pharmacy Agent**: Processes medication reviews, drug interactions, adherence support
- Each agent returns both structured JSON data and editable forms

### 4. Dashboard Interface ✅
- **Responsive web interface** built with Bootstrap
- **File upload functionality** for Excel patient data
- **Interactive forms** for caregiver input
- **Real-time processing** with loading indicators
- **Results visualization** showing routing decisions and agent responses

### 5. AWS Infrastructure ✅
- **Complete Terraform configuration** for AWS deployment
- **ECS Fargate** for containerized application hosting
- **Application Load Balancer** for high availability
- **ECR repository** for Docker image management
- **VPC with public/private subnets** for security
- **CloudWatch logging** and monitoring
- **SSM Parameter Store** for secure secrets management

### 6. Documentation ✅
- **Comprehensive API documentation** with examples
- **Deployment guide** for both local and AWS environments
- **Testing documentation** with unit and integration tests
- **Architecture diagrams** and technical specifications
